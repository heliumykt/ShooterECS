# ShooterECS
ShooterECS is a simple ECS-based shooter game project developed using Unity. It is designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my proficiency.

**Roadmap:**
1) init project ✓✓✓
2) Cinemachine
3) Shooting mechanics (Object Pool)
4) Enemies (Factory)
5) Player run (State)
6) ...

**Used Packages:**

Zenject: For Dependency Injection and managing game services. Helps to decouple game components and manage dependencies efficiently.

Unity Input System: For handling player input across various devices, providing more flexibility and control over input actions.

UniRx: For reactive programming and event handling. Allows the use of observables to manage game state and events efficiently.

UniTask: For asynchronous programming with tasks, improving performance and avoiding Unity’s main thread blockages.

Leopotam ECS (LeoECS): For optimizing and implementing Entity Component System (ECS) patterns, ensuring high performance and scalability in game development.

UniLeo: For integrating LeoECS with Unity, improving the efficiency and ease of use of ECS in Unity projects.

Cinemachine: For advanced camera controls and creating dynamic and cinematic camera behaviors that respond to gameplay.

Addressables: For managing assets dynamically, enabling efficient loading and unloading of resources, improving performance and memory management.

DOTween: For animation and tweening, allowing smooth transitions and animations with minimal overhead.

Unity Localization: For managing and displaying localized text, audio, and images, with support for dynamic language switching.

FMOD: FMOD is a proprietary sound effects engine and authoring tool for video games and applications developed by Firelight Technologies.

Easy Save: Easy Save lets you save almost anything with ease across platforms, along with features such as encryption, compression, save slots, cloud storage, spreadsheets, backups, and much more. (PAID)
